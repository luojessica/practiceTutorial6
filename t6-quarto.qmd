title: "Tutorial 6: Refactoring R Code"
---

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

data <- read.csv("data/penguins.csv")
head(data)
```

# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.


# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

```{r}
conf_mat <- readRDS("output/conf.rds")
conf_mat
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

  - Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
